<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

In this project, I start by cleaning up the departments. I change the SysAdmins department to a Top-Level Department and DELETE the Maintenance department. To do this, log in as admin, go to Agents > Departments, select Maintenance, click More, then Delete.

Go to http://localhost/osTicket and open a new ticket.

<h2>Intake</h2>

<p>
I start by creating tickets as an end-user to simulate real-world scenarios, such as reporting a system outage or a broken device. Each ticket is submitted to reflect common issues that need to be tracked and resolved.

</p>

<p>
As a Help Desk Agent, I review each ticketâ€™s properties, including priority, department, SLA, and assigned personnel. I assign the appropriate values, such as setting high-priority tickets to Sev-A with strict SLAs and routing them to the relevant departments. I also adjust permissions to demonstrate how ticket visibility changes based on roles.

</p>
<p>
After assigning the tickets, I work on resolving the issues. For example, I troubleshoot and resolve the reported problems, document updates in the ticket, and communicate progress with the end-user to keep them informed.</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Finally, I close the tickets after completing the required tasks and verifying the solutions. I document the resolution in detail, ensuring the end-user is notified, and confirm that the issue is fully resolved before marking it as complete.
